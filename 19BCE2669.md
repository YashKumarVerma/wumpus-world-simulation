# WumPus World 


This report documents the simulation of the classical Wumpus world problem. The constraints of the problem have been adapted from the document shared previously via VToP.


## Implementation
The implementation of the simulator has been done in Python (v3.7.5) and the entire project code has been upload on [this github repository](https://github.com/YashKumarVerma/wumpus-world-simulation), so that it is easier to reproduce and test locally.

## Project Structure
For simplicity, and to demonstrate the implementation of the agent clearly, the codebase has been written following the OOP principles and utility implementations like loggers, i/o classes have been kept in a separate directory.

- **world.py** -> contains main simulation and agent logic
- **util/block.py** -> contains implementation of a block in the wold
- **util/interface.py** -> provides function to take input from user and typecast it
- **util/logger.py** -> logger function to display output with context and color

and then all components are being included into the main world.py
